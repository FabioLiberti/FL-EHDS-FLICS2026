\begin{abstract}
The European Health Data Space (EHDS), established by Regulation (EU) 2025/327 and effective March 2025, mandates cross-border health data analytics while preserving citizen privacy. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as the key enabling technology for secondary use, yet systematic evidence synthesis reveals critical implementation gaps: only 23\% of FL implementations achieve sustained production deployment in healthcare settings, with hardware heterogeneity (78\%) and non-IID data distributions (67\%) as dominant technical barriers. Legal uncertainties regarding gradient data status under GDPR and controller/processor responsibilities remain unresolved. We present FL-EHDS, a three-layer compliance framework integrating governance mechanisms (Health Data Access Bodies, data permits, opt-out registries), FL orchestration (aggregation within Secure Processing Environments, differential privacy), and data holder components (adaptive training, FHIR preprocessing). The framework maps evidence-based barriers to specific mitigation strategies and provides compliance checkpoints aligned with EHDS requirements. This paper contributes: (1) the first systematic barrier taxonomy for FL in EHDS contexts based on 47 documents following PRISMA methodology; (2) a reference architecture addressing identified technical, legal, and organizational gaps; (3) an open-source reference implementation providing modular components for practical deployment; (4) an implementation roadmap for the critical 2025-2031 transition period with prioritized actions for policymakers, national authorities, and healthcare organizations.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The European Health Data Space (EHDS), established by Regulation (EU) 2025/327, represents the European Union's most ambitious initiative for cross-border health data governance~\cite{eu2025ehds}. Entering into force on 26 March 2025, the regulation creates a dual framework: primary use through MyHealth@EU infrastructure for direct patient care, and secondary use through HealthData@EU for research, innovation, and evidence-based policy-making~\cite{hussein2025interop}.

The EHDS introduces novel governance mechanisms of unprecedented complexity. Health Data Access Bodies (HDABs) are designated in each Member State to evaluate and authorize secondary use requests through data permits. Article 53 enumerates permitted purposes including scientific research, public health surveillance, and AI training; Article 71 introduces opt-out mechanisms allowing citizens to object to secondary use of their electronic health data~\cite{staunton2024ethical}. The implementation timeline extends to 2031, with delegated acts expected by March 2027 and secondary use provisions applicable from March 2029.

\subsection{The Technology-Governance Divide}

Federated Learning (FL) emerges as the theoretically ideal technical solution for EHDS secondary use---the model travels to distributed data sources rather than centralizing sensitive health records~\cite{rieke2020future}. This ``data stays home'' principle aligns with GDPR data minimization requirements and addresses legitimate concerns about health data sovereignty across 27 Member States~\cite{mcmahan2017communication}.

However, recent evidence reveals a sobering gap between FL's theoretical promise and operational reality. Fr\"ohlich et al.~\cite{frohlich2025reality} report that only 23\% of reviewed FL implementations achieve sustained production deployment in healthcare settings. Technical barriers persist: hardware heterogeneity affects 78\% of pilot participants; non-IID data challenges impact 67\% of tested models. Beyond technical constraints, legal uncertainties regarding gradient data status under GDPR and controller/processor responsibilities in FL architectures remain unresolved~\cite{quinn2024gdpr}, creating compliance risks that discourage organizational adoption.

Van Drumpt et al.~\cite{vandrumpt2025pets} demonstrate through expert interviews that privacy-enhancing technologies cannot substitute for robust governance frameworks---public trust depends primarily on institutional transparency and accountability rather than technical privacy guarantees alone.

\subsection{Contributions}

This paper bridges the technology-governance divide by making four contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Barrier Taxonomy}: Systematic evidence synthesis of FL implementation barriers specific to EHDS contexts (47 documents, PRISMA methodology, GRADE-CERQual confidence assessment).
    \item \textbf{FL-EHDS Framework}: A three-layer reference architecture with compliance checkpoints mapping barriers to mitigation strategies.

\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{European Health Data Space}

The EHDS establishes HDABs in each Member State to authorize secondary use through standardized data permits. Secure Processing Environments (SPEs) provide controlled settings for analytics without data leaving institutional boundaries~\cite{svingel2025hdab}. Table~\ref{tab:timeline} presents the implementation timeline with FL-specific relevance.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{EHDS Implementation Timeline}
\label{tab:timeline}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Date} & \textbf{Milestone} & \textbf{FL Relevance} \\
\midrule
Mar 2025 & Entry into force & Legal framework active \\
Mar 2027 & Delegated acts & Gradient status clarification \\
Mar 2029 & Secondary use application & FL must be operational \\
Mar 2031 & Genetic, imaging data & Extended FL requirements \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Forster et al.~\cite{forster2025journeys} document significant variability in current data access experiences across Member States, with timelines ranging from 3 weeks (Finland) to over 12 months (France). Critically, barriers are primarily organizational and procedural rather than technical, suggesting that infrastructure investments alone will not resolve access inequities.

\subsection{Federated Learning Fundamentals}

FL inverts the traditional machine learning paradigm: rather than centralizing data, the model travels to distributed sources~\cite{mcmahan2017communication}. Local training produces gradients; these are aggregated centrally (typically via FedAvg or FedProx algorithms) and redistributed for iterative refinement~\cite{li2020federated, kairouz2021advances}. Known challenges include: non-IID data distributions causing convergence difficulties~\cite{li2020federated}; communication costs for gradient exchange~\cite{bonawitz2019scale}; and privacy attacks including gradient inversion~\cite{zhu2019deep} and membership inference~\cite{shokri2017membership}.

Teo et al.~\cite{teo2024systematic} conducted a comprehensive systematic review of FL in healthcare (612 articles), finding that the majority remain proof-of-concept studies with only 5.2\% achieving real-life application. This maturity gap has direct implications for EHDS timelines.

\subsection{Related Work}

Prior FL frameworks for healthcare~\cite{rieke2020future, peng2024systematic} focus on technical architectures without addressing regulatory compliance in specific jurisdictions. Legal analyses~\cite{quinn2024gdpr, staunton2024ethical} examine GDPR constraints but abstract from implementation feasibility. Policy documents from TEHDAS~\cite{tehdas2024ready} assess Member State readiness but do not integrate technical FL considerations.

FL-EHDS uniquely bridges these dimensions by: (1) grounding the framework in systematic evidence synthesis; (2) explicitly addressing EHDS regulatory requirements; and (3) mapping technical barriers to governance-aware mitigation strategies.

% ============================================================================
\section{FL-EHDS Framework}
\label{sec:framework}

We present FL-EHDS, a three-layer compliance framework designed for EHDS cross-border health analytics. The architecture addresses identified barriers while maintaining alignment with regulatory requirements.

\subsection{Architecture Overview}

Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the FL-EHDS architecture comprising three integrated layers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Layer 1 (Governance)}: HDAB integration, data permit verification, opt-out registry synchronization, compliance audit logging.
    \item \textbf{Layer 2 (FL Orchestration)}: Aggregation within SPE boundaries, privacy protection modules (differential privacy, gradient clipping), purpose limitation enforcement.
    \item \textbf{Layer 3 (Data Holders)}: Adaptive local training engines, FHIR preprocessing pipelines, secure gradient communication.
\end{itemize}

% ===== INCLUDE FIGURE FROM figures/ FOLDER =====
\input{figures/fig2-fl-ehds-architecture}

\subsection{Layer 1: Governance Layer}

\textbf{HDAB Integration}: Standardized APIs enable automated data permit verification before FL training initiation. Multi-HDAB synchronization protocols coordinate cross-border studies involving multiple Member States, addressing the coordination complexity identified by Christiansen et al.~\cite{christiansen2025pilot}.

\textbf{Opt-out Registry}: National opt-out registries are consulted before each training round, ensuring Article 71 compliance. The framework implements granular opt-out checking at the record level while maintaining performance through caching mechanisms.

\textbf{Compliance Logging}: Comprehensive audit trails satisfy GDPR Article 30 requirements, documenting data access, processing purposes, and model outputs for regulatory inspection.

\subsection{Layer 2: FL Orchestration Layer}

\textbf{Aggregation Module}: The framework implements FedAvg~\cite{mcmahan2017communication} as the baseline aggregation algorithm, with FedProx~\cite{li2020federated} extensions for handling non-IID data distributions. Gradient compression techniques reduce communication overhead for cross-border model synchronization.

\textbf{Privacy Protection}: Differential privacy with configurable $\varepsilon$-budget provides formal privacy guarantees~\cite{dwork2014dp}. Gradient clipping bounds individual contribution magnitude, mitigating gradient inversion attacks~\cite{zhu2019deep}. Membership inference defense mechanisms prevent determination of training set membership~\cite{shokri2017membership}.

\textbf{Purpose Limitation}: Technical enforcement of permitted purposes (Article 53) through model output filtering and use-case validation, preventing scope creep beyond authorized analytics.

\subsection{Layer 3: Data Holder Layer}

\textbf{Adaptive Training Engine}: Resource-aware model partitioning addresses hardware heterogeneity (78\% barrier prevalence). The engine dynamically adjusts batch sizes, model complexity, and synchronization frequency based on local computational capabilities.

\textbf{FHIR Preprocessing}: Data normalization pipelines ensure interoperability across heterogeneous EHR systems. Only 34\% of European healthcare providers achieve full FHIR compliance~\cite{hussein2025interop}; the preprocessing module bridges format gaps through automated transformation.

\textbf{Secure Communication}: End-to-end encrypted gradient transmission ensures no raw data leaves institutional boundaries. Certificate-based authentication validates participant identity within the FL consortium.

\subsection{Reference Implementation}

A modular Python implementation of the FL-EHDS framework is available as open-source software at:

\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/FabioLiberti/FL-EHDS-FLICS2026}
\end{center}

\noindent The implementation provides: (1) governance components for HDAB integration, permit management, and Article 71 opt-out compliance; (2) orchestration modules implementing FedAvg/FedProx aggregation with differential privacy ($\varepsilon$-budget tracking) and secure aggregation; (3) data holder utilities for adaptive training and FHIR R4 preprocessing; (4) reproducible benchmarks generating all experimental results reported in Section~\ref{sec:experiments}.

% ============================================================================
% 4. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
% ============================================================================
\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{sec:experiments}

We evaluate the FL-EHDS framework through comprehensive experiments simulating cross-border healthcare analytics. All results are fully reproducible via the benchmark suite in the repository.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\textbf{Task}: Binary classification for cardiovascular event risk prediction using five clinical features: age, BMI, systolic blood pressure, glucose level, and cholesterol. Features are normalized and labels generated from a logistic risk model.

\textbf{Data Distribution}: We simulate 3--7 hospitals across EU Member States with configurable non-IID distributions. Each hospital has 300--500 patient records with hospital-specific demographic biases (e.g., varying age distributions by region). Non-IID degree ranges from 0 (IID) to 0.8 (highly heterogeneous).

\textbf{Model}: Logistic regression classifier trained via federated optimization. While simpler than deep learning models, this choice isolates FL algorithm behavior from model complexity confounds.

\textbf{Metrics}: We report accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, precision, and recall. All experiments run 50 rounds with 3 local epochs per round.

\subsection{Comprehensive Results}

\subsection{Key Findings}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Non-IID Robustness}: The framework achieves stable performance (56--58\% accuracy) across IID and non-IID configurations, with AUC-ROC consistently at 0.63--0.64.

    \item \textbf{Privacy Cost}: Differential privacy with $\varepsilon$=10 incurs 1.4 percentage point accuracy drop; $\varepsilon$=1 (strong privacy) costs 5.2pp---acceptable for EHDS compliance.

    \item \textbf{FedProx Stability}: FedProx reduces client variance but with marginal accuracy differences for this dataset, suggesting FedAvg suffices for moderately non-IID healthcare data.

    \item \textbf{Linear Scalability}: Communication cost scales linearly with participants (3.5 KB/hospital/round), supporting 7+ hospital federations.
\end{enumerate}

% 5. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS
% ============================================================================
\section{Evidence Synthesis}
\label{sec:evidence}

The following systematic review provides context for the technical barriers addressed by FL-EHDS and validated in Section~\ref{sec:experiments}.

\subsection{Methodology}

We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Database searches (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, arXiv) identified 847 records; after screening, 47 documents met inclusion criteria (publication 2022-2026, explicit FL/EHDS focus, peer-reviewed or recognized institutional origin). Quality was assessed using MMAT; confidence in findings using GRADE-CERQual. Full methodology is available from the corresponding author.

\subsection{Technical Barriers}

Table~\ref{tab:barriers} summarizes FL implementation barriers with prevalence, evidence sources, and FL-EHDS mitigation strategies.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{FL Implementation Barriers for EHDS}
\label{tab:barriers}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{p{2.0cm}cp{2.0cm}p{1.8cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Barrier} & \textbf{Prev.} & \textbf{Evidence} & \textbf{Mitigation} \\
\midrule
Hardware heterogeneity & 78\% & Fr\"ohlich 2025 & Adaptive engine \\
Non-IID data & 67\% & Multiple & FedProx \\
Production gap & 23\% & Fr\"ohlich 2025 & Ref. implementation \\
FHIR compliance & 34\% & Hussein 2025 & Preprocessing \\
Communication cost & High & Bonawitz 2019 & Compression \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{GRADE-CERQual confidence}: MODERATE for technical barriers (limited by small number of rigorous evaluations in EHDS-specific contexts).

\subsection{Legal Uncertainties}

Three critical legal questions remain unresolved, creating compliance uncertainty that inhibits organizational FL adoption~\cite{quinn2024gdpr}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Gradient data status}: Are model gradients ``personal data'' under GDPR? Gradient inversion attacks demonstrate potential re-identification~\cite{zhu2019deep}, but practical feasibility in production FL remains contested.
    \item \textbf{Model anonymity thresholds}: When does an aggregated model become sufficiently ``anonymous'' to escape GDPR scope? No established legal threshold exists.
    \item \textbf{Controller/processor allocation}: In multi-party FL, who bears data controller responsibilities---data holders, aggregation server operators, or model users?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{GRADE-CERQual confidence}: MODERATE (coherent findings but rapidly evolving regulatory landscape).

\subsection{Organizational Barriers}

HDAB capacity shows significant variation across Member States. TEHDAS assessments~\cite{tehdas2024ready} reveal Nordic countries (Estonia, Finland, Denmark) demonstrate 2-3 year advantages in HDAB capacity-building, established health data infrastructure, and cross-border experience. Southern and Eastern European states face compressed timelines with limited baseline capacity, raising concerns about implementation equity.

\textbf{GRADE-CERQual confidence}: HIGH (consistent findings across multiple high-quality studies).

\section{Implementation Roadmap}
\label{sec:roadmap}

Table~\ref{tab:roadmap} presents a phased implementation roadmap aligned with EHDS milestones.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{FL-EHDS Implementation Roadmap}
\label{tab:roadmap}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{llp{3.2cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Phase} & \textbf{Timeline} & \textbf{Priority Actions} \\
\midrule
Foundation & 2025-26 & Reference implementation; multi-MS pilots \\
Clarification & 2027 & Delegated acts; legal guidance \\
Scaling & 2028-29 & Production deployment; capacity building \\
Operation & 2029-31 & Full cross-border analytics \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Stakeholder-Specific Recommendations}

\textbf{EU Policymakers}: The March 2027 delegated acts represent a critical window. We recommend explicit guidance on: (1) gradient data status under GDPR; (2) controller/processor determination for FL architectures; (3) anonymization thresholds for aggregated models; (4) technical specifications for FL within SPEs.

\textbf{National Authorities}: Early investment in HDAB organizational capacity is essential. Staff training on FL evaluation, coordination protocols with other Member States, and stakeholder engagement with citizens about FL approaches should be prioritized. The 2-3 year Nordic advantage~\cite{tehdas2024ready} demonstrates that governance capacity may prove more constraining than technical infrastructure.

\textbf{Healthcare Organizations}: Preparation cannot wait for 2029. Organizations should: (1) accelerate FHIR compliance beyond the current 34\% baseline; (2) participate in HealthData@EU pilots to gain FL experience; (3) assess computational infrastructure for FL participation; (4) develop internal governance policies for responding to HDAB data access requests.

% 7. DISCUSSION
% ============================================================================
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Key Finding: Legal Uncertainties as Critical Blocker}

Our synthesis reveals that \textbf{legal uncertainties---not technical barriers---constitute the critical blocker} for FL adoption in EHDS contexts. While technical challenges (hardware heterogeneity, non-IID data, communication costs) are significant, they are tractable through known algorithmic solutions implemented in FL-EHDS Layer 2-3 components.

In contrast, unresolved regulatory questions create compliance uncertainty that healthcare organizations cannot navigate through engineering alone. Without clarification of gradient data status, organizations face potential GDPR violations regardless of technical privacy measures implemented. This finding aligns with van Drumpt et al.'s~\cite{vandrumpt2025pets} conclusion that governance frameworks are prerequisites, not alternatives, to technical solutions.

\subsection{Limitations}

This study has limitations informing interpretation. First, the FL/EHDS literature is rapidly evolving; publications after January 2026 are not captured. Second, most included studies analyze the newly-adopted regulation rather than actual implementation---empirical evidence on operational EHDS FL systems does not yet exist. Third, while our experimental evaluation (Section~\ref{sec:experiments}) validates framework functionality with synthetic data, real-world HealthData@EU pilot integration with clinical datasets remains essential future work. The synthetic cardiovascular data provides controlled reproducibility but cannot capture the full complexity of production EHR systems.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper presents FL-EHDS, a three-layer compliance framework bridging the technology-governance divide for cross-border health analytics under the European Health Data Space regulation.

Our systematic evidence synthesis reveals that \textbf{legal uncertainties---not technical barriers---constitute the critical blocker} for FL adoption in EHDS contexts. While technical challenges (hardware heterogeneity affecting 78\% of implementations, non-IID data impacting 67\% of models) are significant, they are tractable through known algorithmic solutions. The unresolved regulatory questions---gradient data status, model anonymity thresholds, controller allocation---create compliance uncertainty that discourages organizational adoption regardless of technical maturity.

The March 2027 delegated acts represent a critical window for resolution. Without explicit guidance on FL compliance, the 2029 secondary use deadline arrives with FL adoption inhibited by legal uncertainty rather than technical limitations. The 23\% production deployment rate documented in current literature~\cite{frohlich2025reality} will not improve through engineering advances alone.

\textbf{Future work} should prioritize: (1) empirical validation through HealthData@EU pilot integration; (2) citizen attitude studies examining FL acceptance and opt-out intentions; (3) economic sustainability modeling for HDAB operations; and (4) longitudinal tracking of implementation trajectories across diverse Member State contexts.

Only through coordinated action across EU policymakers, national authorities, and healthcare organizations can Federated Learning fulfill its potential as the enabling technology for privacy-preserving health analytics benefiting European citizens.

\section{FL-EHDS Algorithm Pseudocode}
\label{appendix:pseudocode}

This appendix provides formal algorithmic descriptions of the FL-EHDS framework components. Each algorithm includes detailed explanations of key steps and their relevance to EHDS compliance requirements.

\subsection{FedAvg with EHDS Compliance}

Algorithm~1 presents the core federated averaging procedure adapted for EHDS regulatory requirements. The algorithm operates in a client-server architecture where the central aggregator (typically within a Secure Processing Environment) coordinates training across distributed hospital nodes.

\textbf{Key Design Decisions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ValidatePermit}: Before each training round, the HDAB-issued data permit is verified against temporal bounds and permitted purposes (EHDS Article 53). This ensures no training proceeds with expired or misaligned authorizations.
    \item \textbf{SelectParticipants}: Implements configurable client selection---full participation (default) or sampling for large federations. Selection criteria may include connectivity, historical reliability, and data freshness.
    \item \textbf{FilterOptedOut}: At each hospital, records from citizens who exercised their Article 71 opt-out rights are excluded \textit{before} any gradient computation. This filtering occurs locally to prevent opted-out data from influencing even intermediate computations.
    \item \textbf{Weighted Aggregation}: Gradients are weighted by local dataset size ($n_h$), giving larger hospitals proportionally more influence on the global model. This follows the original FedAvg formulation and is appropriate when data quality is uniform.
    \item \textbf{ClipGradient}: L2-norm clipping bounds individual hospital contributions, providing the sensitivity bound required for differential privacy and limiting the influence of any single institution.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\textbf{Algorithm 1: FL-EHDS FedAvg Training}\\[2pt]
\textbf{Input:} Hospitals $\mathcal{H} = \{h_1, \ldots, h_K\}$, permit $P$, rounds $T$\\

\hspace*{8mm}$\theta^{(t)} \leftarrow \theta^{(t-1)} + \frac{1}{\sum_h n_h} \sum_{h \in \mathcal{H}_t} n_h \cdot \Delta_h^{(t)}$\\
\hspace*{8mm}LogCompliance($t$, $\mathcal{H}_t$)\\
\hspace*{4mm}\textbf{return} $\theta^{(T)}$\\[4pt]

\hspace*{12mm}$\theta_h \leftarrow \theta_h - \eta \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta_h; \mathcal{B})$\\
\hspace*{4mm}$\Delta_h \leftarrow \theta_h - \theta$\\
\hspace*{4mm}// Privacy protection (Layer 3)\\
\hspace*{4mm}$\Delta_h \leftarrow$ ClipGradient($\Delta_h$, $C$)\\
\hspace*{4mm}\textbf{return} $\Delta_h$, $|\mathcal{D}_h|$
}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Differential Privacy Mechanism}

Algorithm~2 implements the Gaussian mechanism for differential privacy, providing formal privacy guarantees through calibrated noise injection. This mechanism is applied at the aggregation server after receiving clipped gradients from hospitals.

\textbf{Mathematical Foundation:}
The noise scale $\sigma$ is computed from the Gaussian mechanism formula where $C$ is the gradient clipping threshold (sensitivity), $\varepsilon$ is the privacy parameter (smaller = stronger privacy), and $\delta$ is the failure probability (typically $10^{-5}$). The formula $\sigma = C \cdot \sqrt{2\ln(1.25/\delta)}/\varepsilon$ guarantees $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy.

\textbf{Privacy Accountant:}
The cumulative privacy expenditure is tracked across training rounds using composition theorems. Once the total budget is exhausted, further training must cease---this hard stop prevents ``privacy bankruptcy'' where continued queries would violate the guaranteed bounds.

\textbf{Practical Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item At $\varepsilon = 10$, noise is moderate with minimal accuracy impact (1.4pp drop in our experiments).
    \item At $\varepsilon = 1$ (strong privacy), noise significantly impacts convergence (5.2pp drop).
    \item The tradeoff between $\varepsilon$ selection and model utility must be negotiated with HDABs during permit approval.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\fbox{\parbox{0.92\columnwidth}{

// Add calibrated Gaussian noise to each parameter\\

\hspace*{4mm}$\tilde{w} \leftarrow w + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$\\[2pt]
// Track cumulative privacy expenditure\\
PrivacyAccountant.spend($\varepsilon$)\\
\textbf{if} PrivacyAccountant.budget\_exhausted() \textbf{then}\\
\hspace*{4mm}\textbf{raise} PrivacyBudgetExhaustedError\\[2pt]
\textbf{return} $\tilde{\Delta}$
}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{HDAB Permit Validation}

Algorithm~3 ensures that all FL operations comply with the data permit issued by the responsible Health Data Access Body. This validation occurs before each training round and implements the regulatory requirements of EHDS Articles 53 (permitted purposes) and Article 30 of GDPR (record-keeping).

\textbf{Validation Checks:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Validity}: Permits have explicit start and end dates. Continued training after expiration constitutes unauthorized processing.
    \item \textbf{Purpose Alignment}: The permit specifies allowed purposes (e.g., scientific research, AI training). Each training run is tagged with a purpose that must match permit allowances.
    \item \textbf{Category Authorization}: Different data categories (demographics, diagnoses, medications, genetic data) require separate authorization. The algorithm verifies that requested categories are covered.
    \item \textbf{Audit Logging}: Every access attempt is logged with timestamp, permit reference, categories accessed, and round number---satisfying GDPR Article 30 record-keeping requirements for regulatory inspection.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\fbox{\parbox{0.92\columnwidth}{
\small
\textbf{Algorithm 3: Data Permit Validation}\\[2pt]
\textbf{Input:} Permit $P$, round $t$, requested categories $\mathcal{C}$\\
\textbf{Output:} Boolean validity\\[4pt]
// Check temporal validity (permit expiration)\\
\textbf{if} CurrentTime() $>$ $P$.valid\_until \textbf{then}\\
\hspace*{4mm}\textbf{raise} PermitExpiredError\\[2pt]
// Check purpose alignment (Article 53)\\
\textbf{if} $P$.purpose $\notin$ AllowedPurposes \textbf{then}\\
\hspace*{4mm}\textbf{raise} PurposeMismatchError\\[2pt]
// Check data category authorization\\
\textbf{for each} category $c \in \mathcal{C}$ \textbf{do}\\
\hspace*{4mm}\textbf{if} $c \notin P$.authorized\_categories \textbf{then}\\
\hspace*{8mm}\textbf{raise} UnauthorizedCategoryError\\[2pt]
// Log access for GDPR Article 30 compliance\\
AuditTrail.log(permit=$P$, round=$t$, categories=$\mathcal{C}$)\\[2pt]
\textbf{return} True
}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Secure Aggregation Protocol}

Algorithm~4 implements secure aggregation using Shamir's secret sharing, ensuring that the aggregation server cannot observe individual hospital gradients---only their sum. This provides protection against a ``honest-but-curious'' central server.

\textbf{Protocol Phases:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Secret Sharing}: Each client splits their gradient into $K$ shares using $(t, K)$-threshold Shamir secret sharing. Any $t$ shares suffice for reconstruction, but fewer reveal nothing.
    \item \textbf{Masked Aggregation}: Clients add pairwise random masks ($r_{jk}$) negotiated through key exchange. These masks are designed to cancel in the final sum.
    \item \textbf{Reconstruction}: The server collects masked gradients and computes their sum. Because $\sum_{j<k} r_{jk} - \sum_{j>k} r_{kj} = 0$ across all pairs, the masks cancel and only the true aggregate remains.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Security Guarantees:}
The server learns only $\Delta_{agg} = \sum_k \Delta_k$, never individual $\Delta_k$. If fewer than $t$ clients complete the round, reconstruction fails gracefully without privacy leakage.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\fbox{\parbox{0.92\columnwidth}{
\small
\textbf{Algorithm 4: Secure Aggregation}\\[2pt]
\textbf{Input:} Client gradients $\{\Delta_1, \ldots, \Delta_K\}$, threshold $t$\\
\textbf{Output:} Aggregated gradient $\Delta_{agg}$\\[4pt]
// Phase 1: Shamir secret sharing\\
\textbf{for each} client $k$ \textbf{do}\\
\hspace*{4mm}shares$_k \leftarrow$ ShamirShare($\Delta_k$, $t$, $K$)\\
\hspace*{4mm}Distribute shares$_k$ to other clients\\[2pt]
// Phase 2: Add pairwise random masks\\
\textbf{for each} client $k$ \textbf{do}\\
\hspace*{4mm}$\hat{\Delta}_k \leftarrow \Delta_k + \sum_{j<k} r_{jk} - \sum_{j>k} r_{kj}$\\[2pt]
// Phase 3: Server reconstructs aggregate\\
$\Delta_{agg} \leftarrow \sum_{k=1}^{K} \hat{\Delta}_k$\\
// Masks cancel: $\sum_k \sum_{j<k} r_{jk} - \sum_k \sum_{j>k} r_{kj} = 0$\\[2pt]
\textbf{if} ActiveClients $< t$ \textbf{then}\\
\hspace*{4mm}\textbf{raise} SecureAggregationError\\[2pt]
\textbf{return} $\Delta_{agg}$
}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{FedProx for Non-IID Data}

Algorithm~5 extends FedAvg to handle heterogeneous (non-IID) data distributions common in cross-border healthcare settings. The proximal term $\mu$ regularizes local updates toward the global model, preventing drift when hospitals have skewed patient populations.

\textbf{Intuition:}
In standard FedAvg, hospitals with extreme data distributions may compute gradients that diverge significantly from the global optimum. FedProx adds a penalty term $\frac{\mu}{2}\|\theta_h - \theta\|^2$ to the local objective, ensuring local models remain ``close'' to the global model.

\textbf{Parameter Selection:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mu = 0$: Equivalent to FedAvg (no regularization).
    \item $\mu = 0.01$--$0.1$: Moderate regularization; our experiments show stable convergence with minimal accuracy impact.
    \item $\mu > 1$: Strong regularization; may prevent adaptation to local data characteristics.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\fbox{\parbox{0.92\columnwidth}{
\small
\textbf{Algorithm 5: FedProx Local Update}\\[2pt]
\textbf{Input:} Local data $\mathcal{D}_h$, global model $\theta$, proximal weight $\mu$\\
\textbf{Output:} Local update $\Delta_h$\\[4pt]
// Initialize local model from global\\
$\theta_h \leftarrow \theta$\\[2pt]
// Local training with proximal regularization\\
\textbf{for} epoch $e = 1$ to $E$ \textbf{do}\\
\hspace*{4mm}\textbf{for} batch $\mathcal{B} \in \mathcal{D}_h$ \textbf{do}\\
\hspace*{8mm}// Standard loss gradient\\
\hspace*{8mm}$g \leftarrow \nabla \mathcal{L}(\theta_h; \mathcal{B})$\\
\hspace*{8mm}// Add proximal term gradient: $\nabla \frac{\mu}{2}\|\theta_h - \theta\|^2$\\
\hspace*{8mm}$g \leftarrow g + \mu(\theta_h - \theta)$\\
\hspace*{8mm}// Update local model\\
\hspace*{8mm}$\theta_h \leftarrow \theta_h - \eta \cdot g$\\[2pt]
// Compute update delta\\
$\Delta_h \leftarrow \theta_h - \theta$\\[2pt]
\textbf{return} $\Delta_h$
}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Article 71 Opt-Out Registry Protocol}

Algorithm~6 implements the EHDS Article 71 opt-out mechanism, enabling citizens to withdraw their electronic health data from secondary use. The protocol ensures that opted-out records are excluded from FL training while maintaining computational efficiency.

\textbf{Design Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Real-time vs. Batch}: Full registry synchronization before each round ensures compliance but incurs latency. Cached mode with periodic refresh balances compliance and performance.
    \item \textbf{Granularity}: Opt-out may apply to all secondary use, specific purposes, or specific categories. The algorithm supports fine-grained filtering.
    \item \textbf{Auditability}: Every filtering operation is logged, enabling demonstration of compliance during regulatory audits.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\fbox{\parbox{0.92\columnwidth}{
\small
\textbf{Algorithm 6: Article 71 Opt-Out Filtering}\\[2pt]
\textbf{Input:} Local dataset $\mathcal{D}_h$, purpose $p$, categories $\mathcal{C}$\\
\textbf{Output:} Filtered dataset $\mathcal{D}'_h$\\[4pt]
// Synchronize with national opt-out registry\\
OptOutRecords $\leftarrow$ FetchOptOutRegistry(MemberState)\\[2pt]
// Initialize filtered dataset\\
$\mathcal{D}'_h \leftarrow \emptyset$\\[2pt]
\textbf{for each} record $r \in \mathcal{D}_h$ \textbf{do}\\
\hspace*{4mm}citizen\_id $\leftarrow$ r.pseudonymized\_id\\
\hspace*{4mm}opted\_out $\leftarrow$ False\\[2pt]
\hspace*{4mm}// Check purpose-specific opt-out\\
\hspace*{4mm}\textbf{if} (citizen\_id, $p$) $\in$ OptOutRecords \textbf{then}\\
\hspace*{8mm}opted\_out $\leftarrow$ True\\[2pt]
\hspace*{4mm}// Check category-specific opt-out\\
\hspace*{4mm}\textbf{for each} $c \in \mathcal{C}$ \textbf{do}\\
\hspace*{8mm}\textbf{if} (citizen\_id, $c$) $\in$ OptOutRecords \textbf{then}\\
\hspace*{12mm}opted\_out $\leftarrow$ True\\[2pt]
\hspace*{4mm}\textbf{if} not opted\_out \textbf{then}\\
\hspace*{8mm}$\mathcal{D}'_h \leftarrow \mathcal{D}'_h \cup \{r\}$\\[2pt]
// Log filtering statistics for audit\\
AuditLog.record(total=$|\mathcal{D}_h|$, filtered=$|\mathcal{D}'_h|$)\\[2pt]
\textbf{return} $\mathcal{D}'_h$
}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{FHIR R4 Preprocessing Pipeline}

Algorithm~7 standardizes heterogeneous EHR data into the FHIR R4 format required for interoperable FL training. Given that only 34\% of European healthcare providers achieve full FHIR compliance, this preprocessing step is essential for practical deployment.

\textbf{Pipeline Stages:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Format Detection}: Identifies source format (HL7 v2, CDA, proprietary CSV, etc.) using heuristic signatures.
    \item \textbf{Terminology Mapping}: Converts local coding systems to standard terminologies (ICD-10, SNOMED-CT, LOINC) using UMLS mappings.
    \item \textbf{FHIR Transformation}: Constructs FHIR resources (Patient, Observation, Condition, MedicationStatement) from normalized data.
    \item \textbf{Tensor Conversion}: Extracts numerical features from FHIR resources into tensors suitable for ML training.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\fbox{\parbox{0.92\columnwidth}{
\small
\textbf{Algorithm 7: FHIR R4 Preprocessing}\\[2pt]
\textbf{Input:} Raw EHR records $\mathcal{R}$, feature specification $\mathcal{F}$\\

// Normalize numerical features\\
$X \leftarrow$ StandardScaler.fit\_transform($X$)\\[2pt]
\textbf{return} $(X, y)$
}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Privacy Budget Accountant}

Algorithm~8 tracks cumulative privacy expenditure across FL training rounds using moment accountant composition. This enables tight privacy bounds when training for many rounds while ensuring the total guarantee is never exceeded.

\textbf{Technical Details:}
The moment accountant (R\'enyi DP) provides tighter composition bounds than basic composition. For $T$ rounds with per-round privacy cost $(\varepsilon_t, \delta_t)$, the total privacy loss is computed via the log-moment generating function, enabling longer training within the same budget.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\hspace*{4mm}$\varepsilon_t \leftarrow \varepsilon_{remaining} / (T -$ rounds\_completed$)$\\
\hspace*{4mm}\textbf{return} $\varepsilon_t$\\[2pt]

\hspace*{4mm}// Update moments after each round\\

\section{Supplementary Experimental Figures}
\label{appendix:figures}

This section presents detailed experimental results from the FL-EHDS benchmark suite, providing insights into client heterogeneity, training dynamics, and system performance. All figures are generated from real experimental runs available in the repository.

\subsection{Hospital Data Distribution}

Figure~\ref{fig:data_distribution} illustrates the non-IID nature of data across the five simulated hospitals. Each hospital exhibits distinct demographic characteristics reflecting real-world geographical variation in European patient populations.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/figA1_data_distribution.pdf}
\caption{Data distribution across hospitals. Metrics shown: sample count, mean age, BMI, systolic BP, glucose, and positive class rate. Notable heterogeneity: Amsterdam shows older population (60.8 years mean age) with higher positive rate (62.6\%) compared to Rome (49.1 years, 39.2\%).}
\label{fig:data_distribution}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Per-Client Training Time}

Figure~\ref{fig:training_times} shows training time variation across clients per round. Differences arise from local dataset sizes (300--500 records), hardware capabilities, and network conditions.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/figA2_training_times.pdf}
\caption{Per-client training time per round. Larger hospitals (Berlin: 500 samples) exhibit slightly longer training times. The adaptive training engine compensates by adjusting batch sizes for stragglers.}
\label{fig:training_times}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Client Participation Matrix}

Figure~\ref{fig:participation} presents the client participation matrix over 50 training rounds. Not all clients participate in every round due to availability, connectivity, or straggler timeout policies.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/figA3_participation_matrix.pdf}
\caption{Client participation matrix (50 rounds $\times$ 5 clients). Participation rates: IT 88\%, DE 86\%, FR 86\%, ES 88\%, NL 92\%. The framework tolerates 10--15\% dropout per round while maintaining convergence.}
\label{fig:participation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Gradient Norm Evolution}

Figure~\ref{fig:gradient_norms} tracks gradient L2-norms throughout training. Decreasing gradient norms indicate model convergence; divergent norms suggest instability.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/figA4_gradient_norms.pdf}
\caption{Gradient norm evolution per client over 50 rounds. All clients show decreasing trends indicating stable convergence. Clipping threshold $C=1.0$ bounds extreme values for DP compatibility.}

\subsection{Learning Rate Sensitivity}

Figure~\ref{fig:learning_rate} compares convergence across learning rates $\eta \in \{0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5\}$. Optimal performance is achieved at $\eta = 0.1$--$0.2$.

\caption{Learning rate sensitivity analysis. $\eta = 0.01$: slow convergence (53.8\% at round 50). $\eta = 0.1$: optimal (58.6\%). $\eta = 0.5$: instability with oscillations.}

\section{FL Algorithm Comparison Analysis}
\label{appendix:algorithm_comparison}

This appendix provides comprehensive benchmarking of five FL algorithms across varying degrees of data heterogeneity. Results inform algorithm selection for different EHDS deployment scenarios.

\subsection{Algorithms Evaluated}

We compare five prominent FL algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FedAvg}~\cite{mcmahan2017communication}: Baseline federated averaging with weighted aggregation.
    \item \textbf{FedProx}~\cite{li2020federated}: Proximal term ($\mu$) regularizes local drift in non-IID settings.
    \item \textbf{SCAFFOLD}~\cite{karimireddy2020scaffold}: Variance reduction through control variates correcting client drift.
    \item \textbf{FedAdam}: Adaptive server-side optimization with momentum and second-moment estimates.
    \item \textbf{FedYogi}~\cite{reddi2021adaptive}: Variant of FedAdam with improved stability for sparse gradients.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-IID Configuration}

Data heterogeneity is controlled via Dirichlet distribution with concentration parameter $\alpha$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha = 0.1$: \textbf{Extreme non-IID} --- highly skewed label distributions per client
    \item $\alpha = 0.5$: \textbf{High non-IID} --- significant heterogeneity
    \item $\alpha = 1.0$: \textbf{Moderate non-IID} --- balanced heterogeneity
    \item $\alpha = 10.0$: \textbf{Near-IID} --- approximately uniform distributions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Convergence at Different Heterogeneity Levels}

Figure~\ref{fig:algo_comparison_noniid} shows convergence trajectories for all algorithms across four non-IID levels. Key observations:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/fig_algorithm_comparison_noniid.pdf}
\caption{Algorithm convergence across non-IID levels ($\alpha \in \{0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 10.0\}$). SCAFFOLD and adaptive methods (FedAdam, FedYogi) show superior stability under extreme heterogeneity ($\alpha=0.1$).}
\label{fig:algo_comparison_noniid}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Findings:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item At $\alpha=0.1$ (extreme non-IID), \textbf{SCAFFOLD} achieves most stable convergence due to variance reduction.
    \item \textbf{FedProx} provides marginal improvement over FedAvg at moderate heterogeneity ($\alpha=0.5$--$1.0$).
    \item \textbf{Adaptive methods} (FedAdam, FedYogi) excel in near-IID settings ($\alpha=10$) but may oscillate under extreme heterogeneity.
    \item \textbf{FedAvg} remains competitive in near-IID conditions, making it suitable for homogeneous federations.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Final Accuracy vs. Data Heterogeneity}

Figure~\ref{fig:accuracy_vs_noniid} summarizes final accuracy (round 50) as a function of heterogeneity level.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/fig_accuracy_vs_noniid.pdf}
\caption{Final accuracy vs. Dirichlet $\alpha$. All algorithms degrade under extreme non-IID conditions. SCAFFOLD shows smallest performance gap between $\alpha=0.1$ and $\alpha=10$.}
\label{fig:accuracy_vs_noniid}
\end{figure}

\textbf{EHDS Implications:}
Cross-border federations with heterogeneous patient populations (different age distributions, disease prevalence, clinical practices) should prefer SCAFFOLD or FedProx over baseline FedAvg.

\subsection{Convergence Speed Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:convergence_speed} analyzes two convergence metrics: (a) rounds required to reach 55\% accuracy threshold, and (b) best accuracy achieved within the first 20 rounds.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{figures/fig_convergence_speed.pdf}
\caption{Convergence speed comparison. Left: rounds to 55\% accuracy. Right: best accuracy in first 20 rounds. Adaptive methods converge faster in early rounds but may plateau.}
\label{fig:convergence_speed}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Resource-Constrained Scenarios:}
For EHDS deployments with limited communication budgets or time constraints, adaptive methods (FedAdam, FedYogi) may be preferred for their faster early convergence, despite potential instability in later rounds.

\subsection{Algorithm Selection Guidelines for EHDS}

Table~\ref{tab:algo_selection} provides recommendations based on federation characteristics:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Algorithm Selection Guidelines for EHDS Deployments}
\label{tab:algo_selection}
\small
\begin{tabular}{p{2.8cm}p{2.2cm}p{2.5cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Scenario} & \textbf{Recommended} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
\midrule
Homogeneous MS & FedAvg & Simplicity, proven \\
Heterogeneous MS & SCAFFOLD & Variance reduction \\
Resource-limited & FedAdam & Fast convergence \\
Privacy-critical & FedAvg + DP & Well-studied DP bounds \\
Sparse participation & FedProx & Dropout resilience \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{MS} = Member States. Heterogeneity arises from demographic differences, clinical coding practices, EHR system variations, and population health profiles across EU regions.
